<p><b>Tesla is recalling more than 1.6 million vehicles in China over issues with steering software and door-locking systems, the country's regulator says.</b>

    The recall includes its models S, X, 3 and Y, and 7,538 imported vehicles.
    
    The problems will be fixed by remote updates to software, meaning the vehicles will not need to be taken to dealerships or garages.
    
    It comes less than a month after <i>Tesla recalled two million cars in the US due to autopilot software issues.</i>
    
    In May last year, the Chinese regulator said more than a million vehicles may have acceleration and braking system issues.
    
    The American electric car giant then discovered problems with assisted driving functions and door-locking systems.
    
    The Chinese regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), described the planned vehicle update as a recall, even though it will happen remotely.
    
    Tesla will release an over-the-air software update for a total of 1,610,105 vehicles, including imported Models S and X and the China-made Models 3 and Y cars made from 2014 to 2023, the SAMR said.
    
    The regulator added that this was to tackle issues with the autosteer function and cut the risk of collision.
